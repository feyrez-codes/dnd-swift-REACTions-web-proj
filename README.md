# Components

- Main page (index): summary information on the campaign and our stops around the map of Khorvaire

- Loot Generator: a randomized loot roller which will take user input, make an API call to an internal JSON database (and a few resources across the web) and generate a customizable loot roll

- Monster Maker: create and track statblocks for enemies and friends present in  campaign encounters. Complete with a customizable static grid to map combat and track stat changes across multiple enemies

- Shop: Utilizing temporary storage, the shop will allow players to make transactions against their character sheets, subtracting gold from a player's inventory and adding items

- Wiki: (tentative), an API call to the official DND 5e wiki to reformat and display information about critical events, locations, and storylines in the campaign thus far
